49673,"Man!  I think I love this place.  I've been a few times and had something new and delicious every time.  Gnocchi, Ravioli, Lasagna, Pizza, Salads...they all are great.  What I like is that they don't slap some tomato based sauce on everything.  When my Goat Cheese Ravioli ($13) came out I was surprised to see that it was basically dry, even though it was cooked in some sort of butter sauce.  Well let me tell you, dry does not equal bland.  It was some of the best Ravioli I've ever had!  It's never been too crowded, but it was really loud when I was there once.  Parking is easy and the atmosphere is perfect.  Casual yet contemporary.  Primizie is definitely in my solid rotation of Austin restaurants.  Oh, and the bill?  I wasn't too surprised by the amount at the end of dinner since I actually looked at the prices on the menu.",1
171551,"I love MUJI. That said, two things are absolutely atrocious about this store. #1 is the import markup. Everything costs significantly more than in Japan. #2 is the layout of store itself. It is a horrible warren. It's impossible to not get lost, or to find things, and don't get me started on finding anybody in the store. Half the time I was here I was trying to find my partner. There are no sight lines in the entire store!",0
5506,"the fajitas are great. I love both the chicken and the steak. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is lovely. plus there is a great view of town lake. the hamburger isn't too bad either. The virgin strawberry daiquiris are yummy made with fresh strawberries and great whip cream.

Downstairs seating and bar is very sleek.",1
38370,"I don't know why, but I'm strangely addicted to $35 T-Shirts.

Lucky Brand for the most part has some really cool clothes. I'm a huge fan of their T-Shirts, I know I go to a jean store to get T-shirts and not jeans, but I'm sorry $140 for a pair of jeans to show off my complete lack of an ass is too much for me to stomach. 
But their T-Shirts are really comfortable and they look cool. I always have fun with the sales staff, they're always friendly and put up with my obnoxiousness.",1
36930,"While my pizza was pretty good I think I ate a fly.  They were buzzing around our table the entire lunch.
I'm pretty sure one landed on a slice as I bit down.
I felt around with my tongue but couldn't really tell.
I looked over at Jon who was really enjoying his burger so I kept quiet.  On the car ride home I felt an itch in my nose and grabbed for some tissue.  I was really expecting to blow out the fly...nope.",1
167783,"Had an excellent experience here! I got the complimentary wine, bf sake. Between the two of us, we ordered Agedashi Tofu, Nigiri Sampler (6pc) and one spicy roll (i think it's volcano roll or smt? -- i rmb it was like california w eel sauce and spicy mayo sauce and scallops).
Food arrived promptly and everything was so yummy!!! Agedashi tofu was on the chewier side (idk if thats how its supposed to be as previous ones ive had have been a bit firmer, but this was good) -- the spicy roll was indeed quite spicy, but i love the scallops!!!! They were generous w them! 

And the sampler-- everything tasted fresh, professional and good!! :) my bf and i managed to sort of split most of them in half haha. 

And finally, bc everything was so good, i couldnt help but order 2 more tapas - the fried soft shell crab + stuffed mushrooms!! 

The soft shell crab was so juicy and fleshy in the middle, and the stuffed mushrooms were creative and tasty! 

What an enjoyable and worth it experience!! 

One minus is the location is a bit hard to notice by Uber drivers, because its further in than the 24hr fitness :)",0
67487,"Yeah, you read that right---the Prince gives 5-star here for the quality of food plus the selection!

Get this, fresh made pasta--your choice of penne or spaghetti, as there's 2 pails of basil or tomato sauce.  I even saw the worker boil the pasta.  

And the desserts?  Chocolate cake , 3 different cupcakes, cream puffs, cheese puffs and if that doesn't suit your fancy, how about caramel popcorn? As per pic...

Love the layout too.  

Main communal table, one of the bigger ones plus charging outlets along the legs.  Then a seating lounge area plus booths as well.  

In the back corner, a quieter computer kiosks section.  A few TVs.  Liked the overhang of lights per comfy chairs.  

Located by B gate Dosmetic terminal.  Of course, you'll need a Platnium Amex.",1
101486,I scheduled two appointments both of which I had to call to find out where the technician was and if he or she was still coming. After the appoinment time of the first appointment  passed I called I was told they would not be able to come out. I rescheduled it for 2 days later and again I had to called after the scheduled appointment time of 6:30pm to determine when the technician would be coming. I was told I would get a call back. Call back came at 8pm and I was told we will have to reschedule again I kindly declined to reschedule as they are clearly not a reliable company if I couldn't even get someone to come give me a quote. I sensed bad service when the time of my appointment came and went w/o a courtesy call with an update. I wasn't even angry because they showed their true colors before I invested any money.,0
131774,"Edit:  it appears that the issues with management were due to some miscommunication.  They have reached out, realizing that I was still unhappy.  They have offered in addition to giving me my refund, to let me see a top tier stylist complimentary, to fix my hair!  I really appreciate them going above and beyond to try and make me happy. 


So I am really upset by the lack of customer service from the owners here.  I went in last week on Friday, and let them know Sunday I would like a manager to get ahold of me.  A few days later I got a voicemail from the front desk lady saying they refunded the cost of service and they'd like to hear more about my experience.  I told them that I went into a salon and they said it would be almost 400 dollars to get what I had originally wanted, and fix my haircut.  The lady told me that she would speak with management and get back to me on what further they could do for me.  You can see the pictures of what I wanted, vs what I got.  I have washed my hair twice and all the toner they used washed out and I have nasty orange highlights almost all the way up my head which look horrible.",0
48246,"Piss poor on every level!!

I'll admit up front -- I came here as a snarky atheist, for laffs. A friend paid the $50 admission for me, so I wasn't out any money -- but it STILL wasn't worth it! Actually, if you're just coming for laffs, I guess it might be worth $50...but if you're a true Christian, save your money because there is nothing here for you.

Everything about this place is cheap and tacky...but not even in a FUN cheap and tacky way. It's just sad. Instead of costumed actors walking around playing Jebus and whatnot, there's only cheesy cardboard cut-outs all over the place -- super lame! 

There are no rides, just really hokey diorama after really hokey diorama full of supremely creepy mannequins. Everything is coated in gold glitter and fake diamonds, like Jan Crouch got methed up, cleaned out Michaels, then went on a 72-hour BeDazzler binge.

As expected, the place is crassly commercial -- cafes all over (serving Chick-Fil-A -- not kidding) and gift shops around every corner. Bu the gift shops don't even sell any cool stuff...just cheap made-in-China crap that isn't even funny enough to be worth buying.

I can't believe people are actually defending this place -- it's absolutely ridiculous, on every level. 

The only saving grace was the live baptism, which was fun to watch. Everyone who volunteers to be baptized gets a free gift -- eternal salvation!! Jebus dunks you in a fountain, in a bathrobe, then you have to straggle out all wet and soggy in front of everyone, with your asscrack clearly visible thru the wet robe. Unfortunately, Jebus's own robe is made of a thicker, more opaque material...so I did not get a glimpse of His asscrack when He got out :(

The other saving grace, and this might actually even be worth the $50 price of admission, is the 4:00 Passion Play....which is a 75minute orgy of blood and sequins that feels like the bastard child of Bob Mackie, Bob Fosse and Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. IT WAS AMAZING!

Unless you are religious and/or seriously deluded, my advice is to hit the park around 1pm. That gives you PLENTY of time to see everything and still get a good seat at the Passion Play. There is no need to spend more time than this -- seriously, I got there at 10:30am and ended up leaving after a few hours, then coming back in time for the Passion Play. There's not enough to do here to justify spending a full day.

Now, you ask...don't I feel bad having contributed $50 to the crooked coffers of the TBN empire?? To that I say: Absolutely not! I am MORE than willing to add $50 to Jan Crouch's hairspray fund -- that woman has an AMAZING look, and it ain't cheap to maintain! In all seriousness, she is one of my style icons, so I don't feel bad at all about helping her out. I saw her lurking in the wings during the 4:00 Passion Play, but alas I had to leave for the airport before she came out...so I never did get a photo with her :-(",1

72470,"I've shopped at Save-On for more than a decade, so i'm quite familiar with the products they carry.  I used to go here specifically for lunch-type items for work, but I have since moved on to greener pastures (No Frills/Nesters/Independent Grocers).  

This particular location is very hit or miss.  Sometimes you'll see them putting up those individual drinks (Nestea, Snapple, etc) for very cheap.  It used to happen very often, but now it's once in a blue moon.  I have a few specific items (Western Family) like Tea which I always go for, but other than that, there's not much in terms of good deals here.  Pay attention to their weekly deals, and try to find items that are on special or free with points redeemed.  Also, if you're going to spend $75+ here, make sure to scan your card at the front scanner thing, and you'll get a receipt print-out of a points bonus that you get if you spend above a certain dollar amount.  Usually it's pretty high like $75+, but sometimes they offer $35+ or $50+.  It's VERY easy to rack up points this way if you shop here consistently for your weekly groceries.

They don't charge for plastic bags, which is another plus.  The parking thing is kind of annoying, but what can you do? it's downtown, so that is expected.  Much better price-wise than Safeway, Urban Fare or some other places.  Good option if you live downtown. Overall, moderately expensive, and just decent if you have a Save-On card.",1
20386,"The Good:
  :: they use local Free-Range and Hormone-Free meats
  :: their brown sugar bacon is pretty tasty
  :: the duck bacon is delicious and flavorful
  :: they are a local business
  :: they attend all the major farmers markets

The Bad:
  :: the pate, while flavorful, is very thin in consistency and not the correct one to constitute a pate. pates are supposed to be thicker than how they prepare it.

The Ugly:
  :: no ugly, but there IS...

The REALLY Ugly:
  :: so my sister, my friend, and i all bought their pate and we all had the same observation: their pate is not the correct consistency of what a pate should be. their pate is very thin and is more of a lighter consistency similar to that of pesto. while we were at the farmers market at the triangle yesterday, my friend and i went to their table to ask them about the consistency. i very VERY nicely asked the woman manning the table, ""we bought your pate and noticed it is not quite the consistency of pate and that it's thinner than it normally should be. do you guys maybe not add enough liver or something to it? or is it something else that might be missing?"" i quote what the woman said to me in response: """"we make it how we like it, and it keeps the lights on"". WOW. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW. i was honestly expecting something like, ""oh i'm sorry you didn't like it, we have our recipe that we blah blah blah and we'll take your feedback into account and blah blah blah."" instead we got an arrogant, defensive response that left a horrible taste in my mouth. then the woman started to ramble about how to make a pate. i didn't ask for the process. i asked why it was thinner than pate should be. i wanted to reply with an astounded, ""oh really? well FUCK you"" but it was earth day and there were kids around and i didn't want to have 5 yr olds repeating bad words b/c of me. needless to say, my friend and my sister left with me and have vowed to never buy from them again b/c of that whole ordeal leaving a bad taste in ALL our mouths. 

Would I go back? No way. They had me as a happy customer until the woman at the booth was unnecessarily an unpleasant and unprofessional jerk. Sorry, kids. Dai Due gets all my money now. Just because you are a local business that shows up at a farmers market doesn't mean you get free reins to be an asshole to your customers and that I will give you blind positive support. You have to earn and maintain your accolades and my repeat business. Just b/c you are a cute little local vendor doesn't mean I am going to be willing to overlook your poor attitude.

This place is OUT FOR LIFE.",1

105548,"My family and I eat here about once every couple years when we visit Orlando. We love the variety of the seafood at the buffet. 

Oysters and clams were fresh (7/10). The lobster was hit or miss, with some very fresh (8/10) and some tasting like it came from the freezer (6/10). The blue crabs were fresh and the Cajun seasoning was delicious (9/10). Prime rib was good as well (7/10). 

Overall, we always enjoy our visit. Very polite and speedy waiter and no wait for seating.",0

177097,"It is rare that I am able to crawl out of my home office cave for lunch in the wild, but I have done so in order to eat at Zo. It's totally worth the effort.

Get the original gyro. The first time I came, I was on a tight schedule and they had just run out of pork, so I gamely plunged into a chicken gyro instead. It was good, but on its own would not bring me back. No, I returned because I was lured by the siren song of the original gyro. And lo, it was beautiful.

The gyro boasts fluffy, soft pita, tender, greasy pork, and a bevy of chopped tomatoes and onions in a lava puddle of tzatziki . . . oh man, it is DELICIOUS. And it is MESSY. You have to be comfortable getting your hands (and possibly face) dirty to get every last savory bite. So try not to wear anything that needs to be dry cleaned. You absolutely need to sit to eat this gyro, and unfortunately Zo doesn't have a lot of real estate for that. Your options are to carry it out, jockey for space at the counter or outdoor patio, or wear a full-body plastic lobster bib from which you can lick the dribbles of gyro guts as you eat. You choose.",0
